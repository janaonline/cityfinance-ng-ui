          This toolkit is a one-stop-shop for all your needs for reforming
          property taxes in your State/ULB. It provides reform recommendations
          based on best-practices implemented nationally and internationally and
          provides a step-wise implementation guide that you can easily follow
          to take immediate action. Reform recommendations in each stage of the
          lifecycle of property tax have been framed as responses to issues and
          implementation challenges, sharply addressing WHAT NEEDS to BE DONE
          and HOW CAN IT BE DONE.

      Assessment of properties refers to the exercise of assessing the value of
      a particular property within the parameters defined by ULB or State for
      the purpose of taxation. The rules and formulae for assigning value to all
      properties within the city are defined by valuation. Assessment is the
      application of those rules and formulas to individual properties. The
      strength of the assessment process can be judged by the completeness and
      veracity of the assessment records. The process of assessment has three
      aspects to it –
      <br />
      1. Assessment methodology used for assessing property tax payable by
      individual properties <br />
      2. Exemptions as defined by statutory provisions <br />
      3. Dispute resolution mechanisms

      Collection efficiency of property tax, which is an important own revenue
      indicator and is calculated as the ratio of tax collected to demand
      raised, is dependent on both completeness of billing and administrative
      efficiencies in the collection process. While many ULBs do not follow
      this, it is a good practice to ensure that all properties that have been
      assessed are billed, tax is collected in a timely manner, and periodic
      payment reminders are issued especially using electronic modes such as SMS
      and/or emails. The practice of maintaining manual records, which is the
      case for several ULBs in India, is also a key impediment to efficient
      billing & collection as it is vulnerable to errors. Significant staff
      vacancies in revenue departments also adversely impact collection
      efficiencies. Although some cities have done well to create online billing
      and collection systems through services of external vendors, they face
      difficulties in managing the system due to inadequate capacity building
      measures being undertaken for revenue officials. Online/digital payment of
      property tax is another good practice whose adoption has been relatively
      slow and varies across cities. For instance, Coimbatore has a relatively
      strong property tax system, but a very low rate of adoption of online
      payment – 14% in FY 2021-22 year.

      Property Tax Management Information System (MIS) exists in all ULBs that
      have an online property register integrated with payment channels.
      However, the MIS systems have generally not been integrated with
      decision-making to improve coverage and collections. There are very few
      examples of States in which MIS systems are used by different levels of
      Municipal and State authorities for decision-making as well as monitoring
      and managing performance. Property tax collection and pendency
      (defaulters) data is also not available in public domain in majority of
      the ULBs.
      <br /><br />
      Most ULBs also lack an ‘incentives mechanism’ which recognizes and
      rewards/ awards above-par revenue officials. Without systematic and
      systemic tracking of property tax revenue collections, and an
      institutional arrangement of rewarding better performing revenue
      officials, the revenue collections of ULBs are likely to remain
      sub-optimal.
